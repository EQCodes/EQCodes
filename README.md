- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eilidh!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in travel, education, design and entertainment technology, and how tech can be used as a force for good.
- ðŸŒ± I changed career into software development in 2021/22, leaving my role as Project Manager in the charity sector. I now work for an exciting little startup called Colloquial, developing our Ruby on Rails app and using other technologies & libraries like Hotwire, ViewComponent and Lodash/fp. I have experience with JavaScript, Python, HTML & CSS, SQL, AWS, React, & NodeJS.
